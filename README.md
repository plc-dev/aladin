# ALADIN:
„Generator für Aufgaben und Lösung(shilf)en aus der Informatik
und angrenzenden Disziplinen“

Aladin aims to be a progressive web app, which offers a platform to students of various disciplines of study, on that exam-relevant tasks
can be generated in a choosen degree of difficulty and can be solved with additional help and instruction without the need of a 
physically present professor/research assistant.

Also the randomly generated tasks provide a discharge on the professors in terms of preparing exams.

Already setup databases are seperately kept [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oMGgmI_tYP98At-NNRKRH8kdGKL03AxQ) due to size limitations of github

The current state of the app is hosted [here](https://aladin-htw.herokuapp.com/)

The swagger api documentation can be found [here](https://aladin-htw.herokuapp.com/api-doc/)
