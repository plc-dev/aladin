# Introduction

ALADIN is a framework that aims to provide a declarative way for teaching staff to design graph-algorithm-based tasks, including task-generators and step-wise task-solvers, for students to solve on their own time, with adjustable task difficulty and adaptive help by the tool.

It includes a library of dynamic UI-Elements, as well as a range of graph algorithms and data generators to design tasks with.
